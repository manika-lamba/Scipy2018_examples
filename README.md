Purpose: Interacts with other widget libraries seamlessly and easy to link two bqplot widgets
* Bayes Hack ipyleaflet - for showing interplay with other widgets

Purpose: Easy to build useful and cool visualizations/animations
* Neural Net Visualization - Graph with the tooltip. Just a few ooh's and aah's. Very quick.
* Feature Visualization iris and digits - Looks nice. Optionally add interactions. Restrict to only iris or only digits
* K-means clustering visualization and animation
* Local regression
* Chakri and Romain's jupyter con example for interpolation instead of the local regression one?
* Should I add the brain visualization as well? - Data download for that is complicated.
