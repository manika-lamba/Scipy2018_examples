Purpose: Introduction and sneak peek into new features

* Intro to bqplot - edit this to have the following new fatures
    * Adding new selector features
    * Adding new color scale features
    * Image mark example - Add additional marks to image? Interactivity example?
    
Purpose: Interacts with other widget libraries seamlessly and easy to link two bqplot widgets
* Bayes Hack ipyleaflet - for showing interplay with other widgets
* Should i have wealth of nations or the correlation example?

Purpose: Easy to build useful and cool visualizations/animations
* Neural Net Visualization - Graph with the tooltip. Just a few ooh's and aah's. Very quick.
* Feature Visualization iris and digits - Looks nice. Optionally add interactions. Restrict to only iris or only digits
* K-means clustering visualization and animation
* Local regression
* Chakri and Romain's jupyter con example for interpolation
* Should I add the brain visualization as well? - Data download for that is complicated.
