Problem Statement: Leverage federal and local open data to identify disparities in access to resources, services, and housing that communities need to thrive.

Data to use: AFFH Data. Six community asset indicators: Neighborhood School Proficiency, Poverty, Labor Market Engagement, Job Accessibility, Health Hazards Exposure, and Transit Access.

What we have so far?
AFFH Data: Demographic data, data about housing projects, transportation, job prospects, poverty, schooling, environmental impact etc etc at the following levels:

CDBG: Community Development Block Grant
CBSA: Core based Statistical Area
Tract: Small statistical divisions of counties
Block Group: aggregation larger than a census but smaller than a block.

Q. Can we compare and see if housing projects which got a CDBG are actually better than the CSA? Can we also look at how the characteristics of people in the housing project differ from outside people?
